# Deep Learning from Scratch

This repository contains some notebooks devoted to getting insight into how neural networks work. It was based on the tutorial based in the book "Grokking Deep Learning"
written by Andrew Trask (see [here](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709)). Concepts, such as forward/backward propagation, gradient 
descent, feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks are presented in the notebooks.
